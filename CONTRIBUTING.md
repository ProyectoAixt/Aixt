## How to contribute?
The `V` to `C` transpiler performs general equivalences between both languages, but the specific characteristics of each microcontroller or `C` compilers such as types or necessary header files must be recorded in a setup file in `.toml` format. The main idea of using that setup file (`port_name.toml`) is to facilitate contributions (appending a new device or board) by simplifying the knowledge required on the part of the contributor. Each contributor has to code the API functions for the specific `C` compiler and also the setup file.

Anyways, you can contribute in any other part of the Aixt project, all your contributions will be well received.
