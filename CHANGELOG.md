## v0.1.5
*8 Oct 2024*
#### Changes
- Give support to `in` and `!in` operands on arrays
- Solve the issue of `else` statements shown from V v0.4.7 onwards


## v0.1.4
*2 Oct 2024*
#### New features
Differente versions of `match` statement were implemented:
- regular `match`;
  - With one or multiple identifiers or literas
  - With one or multiple *Infix* expressions (comparisons)
  - With one or multiple ranges
- assignment by `match`:
  - With one or multiple identifiers or literas
  - With one or multiple *Infix* expressions (comparisons)
  - With one or multiple ranges
The `match` statements for *enums* are not allowed yet.


## v0.1.3
*28 Sep 2024*
#### New features
All the setup files were migrated from `.toml` to `.json`


## v0.1.2
*27 Sep 2024*
#### Devices Supported
Devices updated to API v0.1.1
- Software emulator
- PIC16F8x family
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Nano
- ESP32-DevKitC
- Raspberry Pi Pico
#### New features
- Compile option was turned into more universal behavior by using pseudo variables inside `.toml` files
- API modules can be written in both `module` and `module_complement` folders
- API implementations can be reused by similar ports or devices calling them from the `.toml`
- Generate C templates for most of the Aixt's V expression and statements using `$tmpl`


## v0.1.1
*12 Sep 2024*
Issue solved.


## v0.1.0
*11 Sep 2024*
#### Aixt V language
Now Aixt V is closer to original V due to:
- All the variables are immutable by default. The `mut` reserved word is fully supported.
- Only a few C pre-processor directives are supported (#include)
- C macros are avoided
- The Aixt API is implemented mainly in V
- Reference variables are supported
- Interoperability with C is improved by allowing the calling of C functions, constants and variables by using the syntax: `C.function()` or `C.identifier`, previous including the correspondent C header file
- declaration/initialization by function calling directly
##### Changes:
- The pin names and modes donÂ´t include the module's name so `pin.setup(pin.d5, pin.output)` changes to `pin.high(d5, output)`, this change is for been less redundant.
- All the variables are immutable by default. If a mutable variable is needed, the use of mut reserved word is imperative.
- Variables can be declared/initialized by calling a function directly, so this two lines: `a := u16(0)` `a = adc.read(an5)` can be replaced by: `a := adc.read(an5)`
#### API standardization
(v0.1.0)
The function names were standardized for these modules:
- `pin`: individual pins
- `port`: pin ports
- `adc`: analog to digital converter
- `pwm`: pulse width modulation
- `uart`: serial port
- `time`: delaying functions
#### Configuration `.toml` files
Now the configuration files are split by device-settings and compiler-settings in different `.toml` files, in order to reuse and make it easy to include similar devices.
#### Supported devices
##### Emulator
Software emulator on Linux, Android (Termux) and Windows (x64-based or AArch64-based device: x64 or AArch64), using GCC or TCC compilers.
##### Microchip
- PIC16F8x family
  - PIC16F83
  - PIC16F83A
  - PIC16F84
  - PIC16F84A
##### Arduino boards
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Nano
*The rest of devices or boards have to be migrated from API v0.0.1*
