# Aixt Project Test Plan

### This plan includes both Smoke and Functional testing sets, which you can find in their respective folders.

#### Smoke Testing:
Is performed to ascertain that the critical functionalities of the program are working fine, the objective of this testing is to verify the “stability” of the system to proceed with more rigorous testing like Functional Testing.

#### Functional Testing:

Is performed to check if the software application performs its intended functions correctly, the objective of this testing is to ensure that each feature and function operates as expected according to the specified requirements, ensuring that the software delivers the desired outcomes before proceeding with more in-depth testing.

The table below shows the number of test cases for each type of testing:

| Testing Type           | Number of Test Cases |
| -------------          | :-------------:      |
| **Smoke Testing**      | 5                    |
| **Functional Testing** | 4                    |

Note: All Smoke test cases must pass before running the Functional test cases.
