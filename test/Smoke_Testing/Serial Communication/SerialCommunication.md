| **CP-SC-1**   | Send character and display in message     | Sending characters over serial communication and displaying them in a message | 1.Verify the functionality of serial communication setup using the UART module. <br>2.Confirm the proper transmission of characters over the serial interface. <br>3.Ensure that characters sent are displayed correctly in a message.                     | This verifies the basic operation of UART communication and character transmission.                          | **Given** I initialize the serial communication setup using the UART module <br>**When** I continuously send characters over UART <br>**Then** I expect the characters to be transmitted and displayed correctly in a message             | 1.**Setup Hardware**: Ensure that the microcontroller is connected to a device capable of receiving serial communication, such as a computer or another microcontroller, via UART. <br>2.**Initialize UART**: Set up the microcontroller environment to initialize UART communication. <br>3.**Load the Code**: Copy the provided code snippet into the microcontroller's development environment or IDE. <br>4.**Compile/Upload**: Compile the code if necessary and upload it to the microcontroller. Ensure that the upload process completes without errors. <br>5.**Run the Code**: Execute the uploaded code on the microcontroller. This may involve pressing a button or issuing a command, depending on the specific development environment and hardware setup. | 1.**Observe Serial Communication**: Monitor the serial communication interface to ensure that characters 0x33 and 0x99 are alternately transmitted at half-second intervals.<br> 2.**Verify Character Display**: Check the receiving end to confirm that the characters received over UART are displayed correctly in a message. <br>The code should operates as expected, transmitting characters over UART and displaying them correctly in a message on the receiving end. | ExampleCode1 |
